## 🏖️ What is "MOOD"?

MOOD days are those perfect Mill Cove moments when everything aligns:
- 🌊 **High tide between noon-8pm** (perfect beach time)
- 🌡️ **Temperature 60°F or higher** (comfortable weather)
- ☀️ **Less than 30% chance of rain** (sunny skies)

When all three conditions are met, the app highlights it as a **MOOD** day - your cue to head to the beach!

- **7-day weather forecast** with real-time data
- **Tide times** from NOAA for precise Mill Cove conditions
- **MOOD day detection** - automatically identifies perfect beach days
